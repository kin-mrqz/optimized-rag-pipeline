### Still in development...

This connects my 2 repositories (rag-wine-recommendation and custom-nlp-parser) to create a unified pipeline for deployment. 
Intent recognition and Named Entity Recognition (NER) spaCy models are trained to generate metadata filters from user query with low latency.
I will be using HyDE (Hypothetical Document Embeddings, after filtering the metadata. 
- First, a short, JSON hypothetical answer to query is generated by an LLM corresopnding to the schema of wine csv database.
- Next, this is embedded and a similarity search is performed between the HyDE and top k filtered wines.
- Finally, RAG model using Bedrock LLMs will be used to generate reasoning for the suggested top 5 wines.

### Current problems (optimization):
- initial filter. implement re-ranking, make more inclusive (rn only first 20 valid entries), prepare backup for faulty filters
- nlp model. train intent recognition and NER model on more data. Possibly create annotation tools.
- RAG for reasoning of wine suggestions. try using AWS Bedrock
